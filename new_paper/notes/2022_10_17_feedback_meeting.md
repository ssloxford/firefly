Firefly: an avalanche effect paper

Name
* Active attacks on satellite systems
* Spoofing satellites from A to Z

We don't claim that it's not known
But we've put in the effort to systematise the whole thing

# Josh
Don't call it "signal injection" which tells you it's EMI - use overshadowing or spoofing
Go into more about other wireless systems, how it's different from sensor networks

Countermeasures:
Attacks in light of likely signal analysis

# Seb

Needs to be in WiSec format (ACM) - sooner rather than later
Move countermeasures to the end
Find a way of shortening related work

Wireless systems:
We've seen overshadowing in WiFi, Zibgee, etc.
Not super detailed about each
But then simmarise

After related work: put the threat model?

# Marcell
polarity -> polarization

Balance bibliography

Read "electronic warfare 101" - since then it has been known that...

Strong part at beginning where we discuss the differences to other wireless systems

First page objective: reviewer to say "well said"

WiFi - spreading codes, contention, etc.

Threat model - describe only capabilities, knowledge - "same as the one assumed in..."
threat model - active wireless attacker, ground-based, has incentive to keep costs of the attack low
    clearly realistic attack means we're interested in keeping the cost low too
Leave pricing in "threat model" into a separate discussion section
"we discuss implication of the threat model in section..."

Figure 2
table with all the variables in, with attacker-controlled ones in bold
with descriptions for each variable, and common values

Gd(theta) - it's a function of angle
Mark the units in square brackets

See "They see me rollin" paper - shows attacker controlled vs non-controlled variables

## Related work
Should be "related" - Eavesdropping can be shortened significantly
"But the most related work is the active attacks" - be comparative

Don't divide into eavesdropping etc. - only the signal injection is related


## Contributions
1) Highly directional dish - show how it opens Pandora's box of challenges
2) Seems boring
3) Only real contribution

"explore the feasibility..." is not a contribution - it's what comes out of it
systematisation of the attack surface

Say this in the context of the motivation, rather than contribution

Focused on answering the following questions: "..."


New narrative for motivation: outline differences to GPS
Has been done with GPS, but this is why we are different

In contrast to the previous work, we now do xyz...

It has been known for decades that wireless communications is inherently insecure
Of course it's important to see the least amount of effort for the attacks to be possible

We know GPS injection is a reality - explain then why it's different

Q: Is a low cost attack possible?
