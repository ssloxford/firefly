Satellite communications are increasingly crucial infrastructure for telecommunications and Earth observation.
However, many widely used satellites are not cryptographically secure, opening this wireless channel to signal injection attacks.
A specialized setup is required to overcome constraints unique to the satellite downlink, overcoming robust data integrity checks, directional dish attenuation, and the complexities in high frequency transmission. % TODO: rephrase somehow?

In this paper, we present a systematic review of signal injection attacks against satellite downlink communications systems, establishing the feasibility and impact through real-world experiments.
Our novel threat model and simulation links attack sophistication and required budget to key properties of the victim system, allowing the vulnerability of existing systems to be established.
We validate the simulation by building the required hardware to overshadow the most common satellite communication types, and injecting amateur satellite communications in the real world.
We achieve internet traffic injection on Iridium and dataset poisoning on NASA's Earth Observing System fleet, and raise concerns about other similar satellite systems and downstream services.
We conclude with a discussion of potential countermeasures and mitigations.
