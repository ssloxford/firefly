Satellite communications are increasingly crucial in applications such as telecommunications and Earth observation.
These purposes are supported by a variety of satellites, many of which are no longer considered cryptographically secure.
Recent developments in radio hardware have opened the door for modern adversaries to inject signals into these channels using only commercially available radio equipment.

In this paper, we demonstrate for the first time the feasibility of signal injection attacks against a representative sample of real-world satellite systems.
We present a threat model and physical simulation that links key challenges such as transmission frequency, receiver type, and protocol to the required equipment budget and chance of attack success.
We validate our findings through an end-to-end experiment, overshadowing real satellite communications.
With only a moderate equipment budget, we demonstrate reliable internet traffic injection, satellite-derived dataset poisoning, and code execution on key national infrastructure systems.
This raises concerns about other satellite systems, which could be compromised by similar means.
