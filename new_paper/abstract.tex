Satellite communications are increasingly crucial in applications such as telecommunications and Earth observation.
These purposes are supported by a variety of satellites, many of which are no longer considered cryptographically secure, opening the door for modern adversaries to inject signals with only commercially available radio equipment.

In this paper, we investigate the feasibility and impact of signal injection attacks against satellite downlink communications systems.
We present a threat model which links attack sophistication and required budget to key properties of the victim system.
We validate these conclusions experimentally by overshadowing a representative sample of real satellite communications, affecting downstream systems with internet traffic injection, dataset poisoning, and code execution.
We show that the transmitter hardware can be assembled with commercially available components for <\$500 across all common satellite communication types.
The raises concerns about other satellite systems and downstream services, which could be compromised by similar means.
We conclude with a discussion of potential countermeasures and mitigations.
