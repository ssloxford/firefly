Walk people through the results
Explain plots in detail

Motivation
Cut New Space section

# Motivation
## Challenges
Many satellite downlinks are unencrypted
Why this challenge is there - not stupid, just not cost-effective and considered worth it

## Implications
This has resulted in eavesdropping - secrecy
But no work into overshadowing - authentication and data integrity
    Has implications further down the systems
    RQ: what is the extent of these implications?
        what can an attacker achieve by exploiting the unauthenticated channel

tables from paper
    list (more details in paper)
        spread across _ domains (examples)
    focus on case study (highlight that one)

Create similar downlink graphic that focusses on our case study
    figure 3 without attacker
    secrecy - only the link is relevant
    authenticity - further links emphasised

Contributions section moved to conclusions
    refine the key takeaways, less what we evaluate, more what we show

# Threat Model
Add fig 3
Reduce first sentence
Add two bullet points (explain subpoints)
highlight in figure what's being discussed

# Attack -> Case Study: FIRMS

* explain, using forest fire image
Cut Attack overview

* experiment setup slide
    what we implemented

* forest fires
key challenges:
 you can't just put red dots on easily

how we solved them:

# Countermeasures
* expand as in paper

generalisability -> challenges

# Conclusion
    code will be provided
    think about key takeaways (as if someone fell asleep)
        if you read our paper, you will learn more about xyz
