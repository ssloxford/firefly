Walk people through the results
Explain plots in detail

Motivation
Cut New Space section

# Motivation
## Challenges
Many satellite downlinks are unencrypted
Why this challenge is there - not stupid, just not cost-effective and considered worth it

## Implications
This has resulted in eavesdropping - secrecy
But no work into overshadowing - authentication and data integrity
    Has implications further down the systems
    RQ: what is the extent of these implications?
        what can an attacker achieve by exploiting the unauthenticated channel

tables from paper
    list (more details in paper)
        spread across _ domains (examples)
    focus on case study (highlight that one)

Create similar downlink graphic that focusses on our case study
    figure 3 without attacker
    secrecy - only the link is relevant
    authenticity - further links emphasised

Contributions section moved to conclusions
    refine the key takeaways, less what we evaluate, more what we show

# Threat Model
Add fig 3
Reduce first sentence
Add two bullet points (explain subpoints)
highlight in figure what's being discussed

# Attack -> Case Study: FIRMS

* explain, using forest fire image
Cut Attack overview

* experiment setup slide
    what we implemented

* forest fires
key challenges:
 you can't just put red dots on easily

how we solved them:

# Countermeasures
* expand as in paper

generalisability -> challenges

# Conclusion
    code will be provided
    think about key takeaways (as if someone fell asleep)
        if you read our paper, you will learn more about xyz


# new notes

[x] reduce screenshots
    what information do we want to convey specifically?

[ ] convey tools:
    packet before diagram -> through tool > packet after -> thing crashes
    what you have to change, how you change it
    we've done all the work to do this
    these tools aren't provided as there's no legit reason to reencode

packet structre
    zoom in on interesting bit

it's variable length, but this application only ever uses two lengths *foreshadowing!*

[x] citations fix
[x] fix footnotes
[ ] 70% dimness for diagrams fading in
[ ] finish countermeasures

[x] fade in experiment setup section
    reduce to pipeline + key

code listing instead of screnshot of RT-STPS (syntax highlighting)
