Feels like a tutorial style
    would need an hour, to slow down and reflect

Too much too quickly

Closer constructio to the paper
Bring the structure out at the start

Not to explain the whole thing
    to make the audience interested to read the paper
    shorten the modulation/demodulation

More time on evaluation
    increasing to 100km to control multiple receivers in one go


Ivan feedback
    Overshadowing "related work" is actually background
    we need work that's actually related

    spend some time saying what comes from our lab, etc.


    Having less content helps you make a relaxed talk
        time to pause

        side things to mention, if you have the time

Yash
    structure slide, speak about what I'm going to say
        intro motivation this is what we're going to do
     contributions forward - he was waiting for contributions
        what is the stuff we "made" and "contributed"
    keep reminding people by backreferencing

    bit error rate
        explain that it's a log scale, explain the graph more
        maybe put in kilowatts
        make sure to say db milliwatts

Richard
    rhetorical questions can invite pushback
        probably cut them

    having Josh's diagram next to multicolour

Radostin
    cut out web pages

Martin
    show a draft classification of satellites to contextualise the example
    replace NDSS with Amogus
    don't show the code

Freddie
    less is more
        few words, riff on the long bullet points
    cut code and protocol diagrams and hex dumps

Freddie R
    use pseudocode in slides, rather than pulling up the example
    talk to US congressional report encryption better
        doesn't entirely imply that it's unencrypted
    swap to his figures

Josh
    define overshadowing
        relating to signal injection
        be more explicit about kill chain example
    tweaking the noise - not really a worst case
    define single DES "the cryptographic standard that's not regarded as insecure"
