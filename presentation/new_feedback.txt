Move experimental setup GNU Radio and NASA pipeline slides to appendix
    Put more content into the appendix
Shift contributions forward - get to the problem a bit quicker

If a slide's there, it's because you want to convey something important
    No slides that are "just there" to gloss over

Problem statements on slides (at bottom?)
    "Challenges of legacy satellites"

Try to summarise each slide in a few words

Style
    Title in centre?
    "Ground segment architecture" - make clear this is a figure title

    Starlink phase one picture has grey line
