potential countermeasure - bounds on signal strength, given historic values

Attacker wants to get as close as possible to the required signal strength

# Threat model
Some function that gives approx. power required

# Experiment 1
The attacker should aim to use the lowest power above the threshold to get the signal through
Visualisation on slap paper could be similar

Best case in beam
Worst case out of beam
Side lobes of antenna

Reference pattern
Radiation simulation
Real world
    See if they all line up

## Method

Variables to measure:
* dish type - diff graphs
* clean vs in buildings environment
* considering gain as arriving at the antenna

multiplier "received" gain vs "measured" gain
does it increase linearly?
given dish type and direction


To think about:
Measure angle
Measure received signal strength
Combine these

Measure with a power meter
* using an SDR is much harder because of variable

1MHz-8GHz
    measure after the downconverter for X band
    measure before the downconverter after
    calibrate for the noise floor
