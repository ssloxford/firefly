\section{Threat Model}\label{sec:threat-model}

The goal of the adversary is to cause disruption to downlink processing systems by emitting conterfeit signals in the vicinity of the receiver.
This disruption can either seek to affect the execution of specific processing pipeline stages, or the resulting satellite-derived datasets by:

% In light of what we've shown about SDS being use din critical applications, where the attacker's goal is to affect the downlink systems.

\noindent\textit{Affecting the satellite-derived datasets:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Injecting false data to mislead people -- for example, to disrupt automated systems for forest fire and other anomaly detection;
    \item Masking important data to deny people information -- for instance, to hide approaching natural disasters.
\end{itemize}

\noindent\textit{Exploiting or disrupting downlink processing stages:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Achieving denial of service -- for example, by causing processing pipeline stages to crash or output malformed data;
    \item Executing arbitrary code -- for instance, by exploiting boundaries between processing applications that have access to the shell.
\end{itemize}

By achieving these, an attacker could aim to affect the datasets by destroying or manipulating recent or historical archived data, preventing new data from being processed and saved, or hiding malicious payloads in a long-term storage database to be triggered by a later processing step.
They could also achieve concrete real-world harms such as rerouting traffic around ficticious fires or failing to warn people about incoming fires.

We assume the attacker has access to commercially available off-the-shelf radio equipment such as Software Defined Radios (SDRs), amplifiers, and antennas, in order to emit signals in the X-band frequency range used by the EOS downlink.
We also assume the attacker is able to maintain a presence in the vicinity of the receiver, in order to inject signals of a sufficient strength that they will be picked up by the receiver.
Crucially, since the receiving satellite dish is highly directional and the attacker is likely ground-based, we do not assume that the attacker can emit sigals within the beam of the receiver.
Instead, they must rely on the signal being sufficiently strong that the ground station picks it up regardless of dish orientation.
We explore this in detail in Section~\ref{sec:physical-layer-validation}.
% TODO: diagram of dish orientation and the attacker's location?

In order to define realistic price constraints, we consider off-the-shelf radio equipment intended to be used in cubesats.
We estimate the overall equipment cost to be approximately $30,000$ EUR -- such a budget covers the cost of a suitable SDR (\cite{limeSdr,limeCompanion}, $598$ USD), a transmitter capable of amplifying and transmitting signals in the X-band (\cite{endurosat:xbandtransmitter}, $22,800$ EUR), and a compatible antenna (\cite{endurosat:xbandantenna}, $6,400$ EUR).
These prices place the attacks within the budget range of a motivated hobbyist, opening the EOS systems up to attacks by a wide range of parties.
With a greater budget the attacker could purchase a more powerful amplifier, increasing the distance from which this attack can be carried out -- Section~\ref{sec:physical-layer-validation} also explores this possibility.

In certain cases, attacks against the downlink processing systems can be made more effective by modifying the in-transit downlinked data in real time, rather than acquiring or creating data ahead of time.
To support this, the attacker must also have a compatible X-band satellite dish.
This raises the budget significantly -- we reached out to a manufacturer of X-band receiver systems and received a quote for $90,000$ GBP~\cite{dartcomsystemsltdXBandOverview2021}.
At this price level a criminal organization or nation-state attacker could achieve these attacks, but a hobbyist is unlikely to be able to afford the required hardware.
Without this hardware the attacker is fully capable of injecting data but is limited to data gathered or synthesized ahead of time.

Other mechanisms by which the attacker could carry out the intended goals may also exist, which are beyond the scope of the physical layer.
The mailing list for NASA's Direct Readout Laboratory (DRL) provides an attractive entry point -- when a downlink transmission is missed by NASA's ground stations or by another organization, it is routine to use the mailing list to ask someone to send over their own copy of the data.
Our attacker can take advantage of the trust inherent to this system's operation and send over malicious frames, which may processed and entered into the DRL's database.
Of course, it is more difficult to carry out this attack at a specific time due to the ``request/response'' nature of the exchange, but it may still be possible to meddle with archived data or attack the processing systems via this method.
