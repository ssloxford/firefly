  abstract = {Environmental Systems and Services is an Australian company which has been designing satellite ground stations for the past fifteen years. Stations have been installed throughout the Australasian region, including systems in Australia, Malaysia, Taiwan, Hong Kong, New Zealand and Antarctica. These systems have utilized L-band (1.7GHz) downlinks from a range of remote sensing satellites, and are used primarily for weather monitoring and forecasting applications. Starting in December 1999, a new generation of X-band (8.2 GHz) direct broadcast satellites have been launched. These systems utilize new methods of modulation and data encoding to allow approximately 20 times the data volume to be transmitted to earth, compared to the previous generation of remote sensing satellites using similar sized antenna systems. This paper is in three parts. The first section describes the new X-band remote sensing satellites, transmission characteristics, their large number of spectral channels, and the applications which will be possible using this new source of data. The second section describes the new ES\&S groundstations in detail, and discusses the developments in antenna technology, receiver design, tracking techniques and software processing which ES\&S has implemented to receive the new satellite downlinks. The final section describes the results and performance characteristics of the antenna system.},
