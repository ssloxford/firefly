Separate into caduutils and ccsdsutils
Make -O flags in Makefile
Makefile: make asan mode
caduinfo line wraps wrong if terminal on narrow width when run, then expanded
print checksums correctly with zeros, so fixed width
make libccsds more const
    libcadu as well with << and >>

cadu router
    Allows routing based on the id
    Allows "fill packet" filtering?

caduhead, cadutail

set up clang-tidy, iwyu

caduinfo to showcase whether the CADU has a valid checksum
    Make it so that the checksum isn't recalculated all the time (disable/set dirty bit in constructor?)
